# Setup Apigee Network Bring using Scripts

These instructions help setup a networking bridge to allow Google Cloud External Load Balancers connect to the Apigee service.

## Installation

```bash
./setup-network.sh $project-id $region $apigee-instance-ip
```

Example:

```bash
./setup-network.sh foo us-west1 10.5.8.2
```

NOTE: The VPC Name and subnet is set to `default`. If you wish to use a different network and subnetwork, pass that as the 4th and 5th parameter. Like this

```bash
./setup-network.sh foo us-west1 10.5.8.2 my-network my-subnetwork
```

## Installation Explained

1. [Check Pre-requisites](./check-prereqs.sh)
2. [Create a GCS Bucket](./setup-gcs.sh) and store VM startup script there
3. [Create a GCE Instance template](./setup-mig.sh) (with the startup script created previously) and managed instance group with that template. 
4. [Provision a load balancer](./setup-loadbalancer.sh) and add the MIG as the backend service

## Validate Installation

1. Use (or create) a GCE VM with an external IP address in the same region as the managed instance group.
2. ssh to the GCE VM and then ssh to one of the VMs in the MIG
3. Run the command to see the IP tables rules

```bash
sudo iptables -t nat -n -v -L
```

NOTE: The command takes a few mins. Here is an example output

```bash

```

## Clean up

To clean up provisioned instances, run

```bash
./cleanup-network.sh $project-id $region
```
